                <h4>Evolving in-App Restaurant Discovery</h4>
              </header>
              <div class="rule short"></div>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
              <p>
                Resy’s consumer channel was traditionally a high-intent utility, with most users arriving knowing exactly where they wanted to eat. The goal was to transform the app into a source of daily inspiration by bridging the gap between editorial storytelling and the transactional booking flow.
              </p>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>The Strategy</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>User Research:</strong>
                  Conducted strategic research to identify friction points in the discovery-to-booking funnel. This led to a streamlined interface for “Add-to-Lists” and immediate reservation triggers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>App Architecture:</strong>
                  Re-mapped the core app architecture to a modern, sheet-based gestural paradigm. This change allowed for fluid navigation between Discovery and Booking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Product-Led Content:</strong>
                  Anchored a new native Discovery View with editorial and algorithmic collections. Users could browse “The Hit List” or new additions with the same ease as a traditional search.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>A Shift to Evergreen:</strong>
                  Doubled down on high-utility guides, such as “Best Rooftop Bars” and “Date Night,” in place of traditional long-form features. This move prioritized content with a longer shelf life, increasing editorial efficiency by creating lasting value for users and moving away from desktop-centric models.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mobile-First Formats:</strong>
                  Conceived “Not to Miss,” a short-form format that allowed the Editorial team to push high-signal updates directly to the Discovery View, without the overhead of a traditional blog post.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>The Outcome</strong></p>
              <p>
                The launch successfully redefined the app’s role in the diner’s journey. The Discover Tab became a primary driver of conversion, with booking rates from this view significantly outperforming app-wide benchmarks. Beyond immediate transactions, the new format nearly tripled the rate of saved-to-list activity, turning passive browsing into a future pipeline of bookings.
              </p>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>Key Learnings</strong></p>
              <p>
                The project proved that shortening the distance between editorial curiosity and product utility creates a virtuous cycle. By building native tools for the content team, the organization increased the velocity of discovery and established an interplay between creative vision and measurable business growth. This alignment demonstrated that design-led storytelling is not merely an aesthetic choice, but a scalable lever for deepening user engagement.

              <div class="rule short"></div>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
              <p>
                As product maturity increased, the challenge shifted from introducing discovery to sustaining long-term quality, clarity, and editorial consistency across a broader surface area.
              </p>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>The Strategy</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Design Maintenance:</strong>
                  Audited patterns across the app to reduce duplication and improve consistency in interactions, hierarchy, and language.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cross-Functional Alignment:</strong>
                  Tightened handoff loops between design, editorial, and engineering to increase shipping velocity without sacrificing quality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Experience Continuity:</strong>
                  Reframed legacy components to align with newer discovery patterns while preserving existing user mental models.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>The Outcome</strong></p>
              <p>
                The system became easier to evolve and operate, with stronger visual consistency and a clearer roadmap for feature expansion across future case studies.
              </p>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>Key Learnings</strong></p>
              <p>
                High-performing products need deliberate maintenance cycles. Structural clarity in the design system reduces long-term complexity and improves team throughput.

              <div class="rule short"></div>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
              <p>
                Resy.com needed to function as both an editorial destination and a high-performance booking surface. Users arrived with mixed intent: some knew exactly where they wanted to book, while others were exploring. The challenge was to close the gap between inspiration and action without sacrificing speed, clarity, or trust.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, the web product had to support continuous publishing velocity and seasonal programming. The system needed to be stable enough for day-to-day operations, but flexible enough to evolve as consumer behavior, merchandising priorities, and platform capabilities changed.
              </p>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>The Strategy</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consumer Entry Points:</strong>
                  Clarified homepage pathways into neighborhoods, cuisines, and editorial collections so users could quickly move from browsing to booking without dead ends.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Discovery System Design:</strong>
                  Established modular content and card patterns that could support both campaign storytelling and evergreen utility, while preserving consistent interaction behavior across modules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Continuous Iteration:</strong>
                  Treated the site as a long-term product surface, refining IA, navigation, and merchandising over multiple release cycles rather than a one-time launch.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Editorial-Product Alignment:</strong>
                  Tightened collaboration between product, design, and editorial so campaigns, evergreen lists, and transactional paths worked as one coherent system instead of parallel experiences.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>The Outcome</strong></p>
              <p>
                The consumer web experience became more adaptable and easier to evolve, with stronger alignment between editorial voice and product outcomes. Navigation pathways became clearer, discovery surfaces became more reusable, and teams were able to ship improvements with less friction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most importantly, the work established a durable operating model for the site. Instead of episodic redesign cycles, the product moved toward continuous improvement, with each release compounding the quality and utility of the overall experience.
              </p>

              <p class="case-section-title"><strong>Key Learnings</strong></p>
              <p>
                For discovery-first products, long-term success comes from systems that can absorb change. Consistent structure, reusable patterns, and explicit content-to-booking pathways made it possible to keep improving the web experience without losing clarity or speed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project reinforced a recurring principle: design systems are not only visual frameworks, they are operational frameworks. When built well, they increase execution velocity and preserve experience quality as products scale.
