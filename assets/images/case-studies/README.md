# Case Study Visuals

Put case-study images in slug folders:

- `assets/images/case-studies/resy-consumer-app/`
- `assets/images/case-studies/resy-legacy/`
- `assets/images/case-studies/resy-web/`

Recommended naming:

- `hero-01.webp`
- `hero-02.webp`
- `detail-01.webp`

Keep source exports at 2x and generate web-optimized assets (`webp` preferred).
